Speare is an ultra lightweight code editor and small IDE. It was originally developed to providing a native scripting language debugging environment that seamlessly integrated with C and C++, and with an efficient code navigation and call routines tracing ability. Speare has very simple interface that allows you to add a new programming language code runner, parser, syntax highlighting, code formatter and debugger to it. You can use the free version to debug C and C++ project. Speare Pro is the advanced version that supports debugging with more programming languages including Ruby, Lua, Python, PHP, Perl and Tcl. Most of the debuggers supports extending themselves in source code level and directly switch between any version of self-compiled scripting language interpreters.<br>
